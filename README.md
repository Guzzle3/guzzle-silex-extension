THIS PROJECT IS DEPRECATED
==========================

This project is no longer maintained and has not been updated to work with Guzzle 5. If someone wishes to use Guzzle via a provider with Silex, then I suggest creating a new repo called something like `guzzle-silex-provider`, and I'll link to it from here.

Guzzle Silex Service Provider
=============================

The GuzzleServiceProvider provides a Guzzle ServiceBuilder and default Client object through Michael Dowlingâ€™s Guzzle framework.  Guzzle is a PHP HTTP client and framework for building RESTful web service clients.

You will need to [install a copy of Guzzle](http://guzzle3.readthedocs.org/en/latest/getting-started/installation.html) in order to use this service provider.

Parameters
----------

* guzzle.services: (optional) array|string|SimpleXMLElement Data describing your web service clients.  You can pass the path to a file (.js|.json|.php), an array of data, or an instantiated SimpleXMLElement containing configuration data.  See the [Guzzle docs](http://guzzle3.readthedocs.org/en/latest/webservice-client/using-the-service-builder.html) for more info.
* guzzle.base_url: (optional) The base url for the default web service client. When left out, the actual calls made must use absolute URLs.
* guzzle.plugins: (optional) An array of guzzle plugins to register with the client.

Services
--------

* guzzle: An instantiated Guzzle ServiceBuilder.
* guzzle.client: A default Guzzle web service client using the base URL.

Registering
-----------

    require __DIR__ . '/../silex.phar';
    require __DIR__ . '/../vendor/Guzzle/GuzzleServiceProvider.php';

    use Silex\Application;
    use Guzzle\GuzzleServiceProvider;

    $app = new Application();

    $app->register(new GuzzleServiceProvider(), array(
        'guzzle.services' => '/path/to/services.json',
    ));

Example Usage
-------------

Using the instantiated ServiceBuilder:

    // Get a command "foo" from "my_client"
    $result = $app['guzzle']['my_client']->getCommand('foo');
    $result = $foo->execute();

Using the Guzzle client:

    $response = $app['guzzle.client']->head('http://www.guzzlephp.org')->send();
